                        <p>A brief introduction to the Church of Christ. The church of Christ dates back to the days of the New Testament (see Romans 16:16). It was founded by Chirst on the Day of the Pentecost, A.D. 33 (Acts 2), just about a month His ascension back to heaven.
                          In the years followed, it rapidily grew to fill Jerusalem, then Judea, Smaria, and finally the whole Roman Empire (Acts 1:8; Colossians 1:23). In America, the first churches of Chris were planted in the late 1700s as a result a movement to "go back to the Bible" and do Bible things in the Bible ways and call Bible things by Bible names(Peter 4:1).
                          <br>
                          We Believe that Jesus is the Son of God (John 20:30-31), that the Bible is inspired of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17), and that Christ will return to take His kingdom home to God(1 Corinthians 15:24). 
                           <br>
                          During the Sunday morning service, the Lord's Supper also is observed by partaking of unleaved bread and fruit of the vine. (1 Corinthians 11:23-29). The service lasts about an hour and concludes with a song and a final prayer. Visitors may sit sliently through the service, or they may participate.
